# Nicolas JACOB PERES' Ethereum Lottery ðŸŽ°

## Description 
Development of a decentralised application for managing a lottery using blockchain technology (Ethereum). I wrote a smart contract in Solidity to manage the lottery, created a backend in Python to interact with the smart contract, and developed a user interface (HTML/CSS) to allow users to participate in the lottery. I used Ganache to quickly launch a personal Ethereum blockchain.\
You're free to re-use my code to improve my lottery and enable it to be used via a website.

## How to re-use
- Step 1 : Install Pyhton and pip 
- Step 2 : Install VSCode
    - After the installation, install the Python and Solidity extensions.
- Step 3 : Install py-solc-x and web3
    - You can install them using the "pip3 install" command.
- Step 4 : Install Ganache 
    - Download it via this link : https://archive.trufflesuite.com/ganache/ 
    - Use the chmod command to make the downloaded file executable.
    - Run the file, click on "Quick start", then discover the tool.
