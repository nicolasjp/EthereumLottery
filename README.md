# Nicolas JACOB PERES' Ethereum Lottery üé∞

## Description 
Development of a decentralised application for managing a lottery using blockchain technology (Ethereum). I wrote a smart contract in Solidity to manage the lottery, created a backend in Python to interact with the smart contract, and developed a user interface (HTML/CSS) to allow users to participate in the lottery. I used Ganache to quickly launch a personal Ethereum blockchain.\
You're free to re-use my code to improve my lottery and enable it to be used via a website.

## Features üëÄ
Here is the functionnality of my lottery :
- You can create a lottery ‚Üí it will create a contract on the blockchain
